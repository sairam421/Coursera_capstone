I am using the example data set provided in the capstone for performing the analysis.  The data provided has al the required information of various accidents along with the 
list of parameters and factors for different locations over a large period of time. The various inputs provided in the data set can help us to predict and analyze the primary 
factors contributing to accidents and can predict the severity of any other accident occurring in the region based on the machine learning model.
