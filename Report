The topic for my project is to determine or predict the severity of accidents in different regions based on the 
available data set depending on various factors and conditions of the accident. This would help in taking timely action for various accidents as well as preventive measures
to be taken for areas having frequent accidents with high severity rate. I would try to use a machine learning model to train the algorithm with the available dataset to be 
able to predict various outcomes of different types of accidents.
